# 🐳 Docker Basics

Welcome to my **Docker Basics** repository! 🚀
This repo contains all the **files, folders, and practice exercises** I worked on while learning the **fundamentals of Docker**.

## 📌 What's Inside

* **Docker Installation & Setup**
* **Basic Docker Commands** (build, run, stop, rm, rmi, ps, etc.)
* **Images & Containers** – creating, managing, and exploring
* **Volumes & Bind Mounts** – for data persistence
* **Dockerfile** – writing and using custom images
* **Networking in Docker** – connecting containers
* **Mini Projects & Hands-on Exercises**

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as my **learning log and practice ground** while exploring Docker basics.
It will also act as a quick reference whenever I revisit containerization concepts.

## 🔜 What’s Next?

I’ll be creating a separate repository for **Advanced Docker concepts**, covering:

* Docker Compose
* Multi-container applications
* Docker Swarm & Orchestration
* CI/CD with Docker

## 🤝 Contributions

This repo is mainly for my **learning journey**, but if you spot any improvements, feel free to raise a **PR or issue**.
